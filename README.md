# robotVisionWithC
This repository is for teaching beginners the fundamental fomrulas for robot vision in C

### Description:
This code is to help beginners learn the fundamentals of computer vision with a language that they should be familiar with. At the University of Central Florida, as well as other universities, the fundamental programming language is C. Students that are interested in computer vision can start with the basic formulas and concepts by stripping them of pre-built libraries and API's and seeing how the work is done using only calculus and known algorithms such as the Sobel and Canny algorithms.
